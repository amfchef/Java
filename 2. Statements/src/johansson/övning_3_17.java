/**
 * When two points in time are compared, each given as hours (in military time, ranging
 * from 0 and 23) and minutes, the following pseudocode determines which comes
 * first.
 *  * <ol>
 * <li> If hour1 < hour2 </li>
 * <li> time1 comes first.</li>
 * <li> Else if hour1 and hour2 are the same</li>
 * <li> If minute1 < minute2</li>
 * <li> time1 comes first.</li>
 * <li> Else if minute1 and minute2 are the same</li>
 * <li> Else</li>
 * <li> time2 comes first.</li>
 * <li> time1 and time2 are the same.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Write a program that prompts the user for two points in time and prints the time that
 * comes first, then the other time.
